                        The car with driver can be rented by anyone above the age of 16. However, in case of self-drive,
                        minimum age for hiring a car is 21 years and your license needs to be at least 1 year old. If
                        you
                        are a resident of Pakistan, you need to have a valid driving license along with NIC. If you are
                        on a
                        tourist visa then you need to have a valid home country license OR an international driving
                        license
                        and valid passport with visa stamp.
